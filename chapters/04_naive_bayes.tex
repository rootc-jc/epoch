\section{Introduction}
Naive Bayes, as the name suggests, is an application of Bayes' theorem with strong assumptions.
We assume a strong independence between the features. We use a very different approach
in Naive Bayes for building the model.

\section{Mathematical Understanding}
Consider there are $K$ classes the model has to classify the input into.
We need $\Pr{(C_k | X)}$ for every class $C_k$.

\begin{equation}
    \Pr (C_k | X) = \frac{\Pr (C_k) \Pr (X|C_k)}{\Pr (X)}
\end{equation}
